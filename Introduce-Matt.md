# Introduce-Matt
Introducee  
This presentation is about my journey up to this point with Infrastructure-as-Code.  I credit Kevin Marquette https://github.com/KevinMarquette with my informal and more formal introduction to PowerShell.  Kevin and I worked together on the same team for about 6 months during 2016.
